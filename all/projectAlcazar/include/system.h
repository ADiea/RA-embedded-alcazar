Please see the document [STM32F051C8 Datasheet.pdf] section 3.7 
					and	[STM32F0 Reference Manual.pdf] sections 
					section 2.2.2, table, bus AHB1 => 0x40021000  RCC
					section 6.4.6 RCC_AHBENR note the offset from the RCC base which is 0x14

//See 6.4 in reference manual

//This macrodefinition means that we take the base address we add the offset and the resulting address we cast to a pointer to a unsigned int
//We return the dereferenced opinter to that address so that we can assign values to it
//Think of it as 
//	unsigned int *pRCC_AHBENR = (0x40021000 + 0x14); 
//	Now instead of writing to that adress always as *pRCC_AHBENR = value, we define a RCC_AHBENR to be #define RCC_AHBENR (*pRCC_AHBENR) 
//	so we can write in code directly RCC_AHBENR = value
